JS Variables

1.Create a variable called carName, assign the value Volvo to it.

let carName = "Volvo";

2. Create a variable called x, assign the value 50 to it.

let x = 50

3.Display the sum of 5 + 10, using two variables: x and y.

let x = 5;
let y = 10;
document.getElementById("demo").innerHTML = x + y;

4.Create a variable called z, assign x + y to it, and display the result in an alert box.

let x = 5;
let y = 10;
let z = x + y;
alert(z);

5. On one single line, declare three variables with the following names and values:

firstName = "John"
lastName = "Doe"
age = 35

let 
firstName = "John", lastName = "Doe", age = 35;

JS Operators

1. Multiply 10 with 5, and alert the result:

alert(10 * 5);

2. Divide 10 by 2, and alert the result:

alert(10 / 2);

3. Alert the remainder when 15 is divided by 9.

alert(15 % 9);

4. Use the correct assignment operator that will result in x being 15 (same as x = x + y).

x = 10;
y = 5;
x += y;

5. Use the correct assignment operator that will result in x being 50 (same as x = x * y).

x = 10;
y = 5;
x *= y;

JS Data Yypes

1. Use comments to describe the correct data type of the following variables:


let length = 16;          // Number
let lastName = "Johnson"; // String
const x = {
  firstName: "John",
  lastName: "Doe"
};                        // Object

JS Functions

1. Execute the function named myFunction.

function myFunction() {
  alert("Hello World!");
}
myFunction();

2. Create a function called "myFunction".

function myFunction(){
  alert("Hello World!");
}

3. Make the function return "Hello".

function myFunction() {
  return "Hello";
}
document.getElementById("demo").innerHTML = myFunction();

4. Make the function display "Hello" in the inner HTML of an element with the ID "demo".

function myFunction() {
  document.getElementById("demo").innerHTML = "Hello";
}

JS Objects

1. Alert "John" by extracting information from the person object.


const person = {
  firstName: "John",
  lastName: "Doe"
};
alert( person.firstNam);

2. Add the following property and value to the person object: country: Norway.

const person = {
  firstName: "John",
  lastName: "Doe",
country: "Norway"};

3. Create an object called person with name = John, age = 50.
Then, access the object to alert("John is 50").

const person  {
  name: "John", age: 50
};
alert(person with + " is " + person age);

JS Events 

1. The <button> element should do something when someone clicks on it. Try to fix it!

<button onclick ="alert('Hello')">Click me.</button>

2. When the button is clicked, the function "myFunction" should be executed.

<button onclick ="myFunction()">Click me.</button>

3. The <div> element should turn red when someone moves the mouse over it.

<div onmouseover="this.style.backgroundColor='red'">myDIV.</div>

JS Strings

1. Use the length property to alert the length of txt.

let txt = "Hello World!";
let x = txt.length;
alert(x);

2. Use escape characters to alert We are "Vikings".

let txt = "We are \"Vikings\"";
alert(txt);

3. Concatenate the two strings to alert "Hello World!".

let str1 = "Hello ";
let str2 = "World!";
alert(str1 + str2);

JS String Methods

1. Convert the text into an UPPERCASE text:

let txt = "Hello World!";
txt = txt.
toUpperCase();

2. Use the slice method to return the word "bananas".

let txt = "I can eat bananas all day";
let x = txt.slice(10, 17);

3. Use the correct String method to replace the word "Hello" with the word "Welcome".

let txt = "Hello World";
txt = txt.replace("Hello", "Welcome");

4. Convert the value of txt to upper case.

let txt = "Hello World";
txt = txt.toUpperCase();

5. Convert the value of txt to lower case.

let txt = "Hello World";
txt = txt.toLowerCase();

Arrays JS

1. Obtenha o valor "Volvo" da carsmatriz.

const cars = ["Saab", "Volvo", "BMW"];
let x = cars[1];

2. Change the first item of cars to "Ford".

const cars = ["Volvo", "Jeep", "Mercedes"];
cars[0] = "Ford";

3. Alert the number of items in an array, using the correct Array property.

const cars = ["Volvo", "Jeep", "Mercedes"];
alert(cars.length);

JS Arrays Methods

1. Use the correct Array method to remove the last item of the fruits array.

const fruits = ["Banana", "Orange", "Apple"];
fruits.pop();

2. Use the correct Array method to add "Kiwi" to the fruits array.

const fruits = ["Banana", "Orange", "Apple"];
fruits.push("Kiwi");

3. Use the splice() method to remove "Orange" and "Apple" from fruits.

const fruits = ["Banana", "Orange", "Apple", "Kiwi"];
fruits.splice(
1, 2);
