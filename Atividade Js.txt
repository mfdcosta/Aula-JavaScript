JS Variables

1.Create a variable called carName, assign the value Volvo to it.

let carName = "Volvo";

2. Create a variable called x, assign the value 50 to it.

let x = 50

3.Display the sum of 5 + 10, using two variables: x and y.

let x = 5;
let y = 10;
document.getElementById("demo").innerHTML = x + y;

4.Create a variable called z, assign x + y to it, and display the result in an alert box.

let x = 5;
let y = 10;
let z = x + y;
alert(z);

5. On one single line, declare three variables with the following names and values:

firstName = "John"
lastName = "Doe"
age = 35

let 
firstName = "John", lastName = "Doe", age = 35;

JS Operators

1. Multiply 10 with 5, and alert the result:

alert(10 * 5);

2. Divide 10 by 2, and alert the result:

alert(10 / 2);

3. Alert the remainder when 15 is divided by 9.

alert(15 % 9);

4. Use the correct assignment operator that will result in x being 15 (same as x = x + y).

x = 10;
y = 5;
x += y;

5. Use the correct assignment operator that will result in x being 50 (same as x = x * y).

x = 10;
y = 5;
x *= y;

JS Data Yypes

1. Use comments to describe the correct data type of the following variables:


let length = 16;          // Number
let lastName = "Johnson"; // String

  firstName: "John",
  lastName: "Doe"
};                        // Object

JS Functions

1. Execute the function named myFunction.

  alert("Hello World!");
}

3. Make the function return "Hello".

function myFunction() {
  return "Hello";
}
document.getElementById("demo").innerHTML = myFunction();

4. Make the function display "Hello" in the inner HTML of an element with the ID "demo".

function myFunction() {
  document.getElementById("demo").innerHTML = "Hello";
}

JS Objects

1. Alert "John" by extracting information from the person object.

2. Add the following property and value to the person object: country: Norway.

const person = {
  firstName: "John",
  lastName: "Doe",
country: "Norway"};

3. Create an object called person with name = John, age = 50.
Then, access the object to alert("John is 50").

const person  {
  name: "John", age: 50
};
alert(person with + " is " + person age);

JS Events 

1. The <button> element should do something when someone clicks on it. Try to fix it!
